# Bluetooth_Control_Robotic_Car
Bluetooth controlled car with obstacle avoidance - IOT Project
### Project Overview

This project involves building a Bluetooth-controlled robotic car that features obstacle detection and avoidance using various electronic components. The system is based on an Arduino Uno board, which serves as the central controller, interfacing with a Bluetooth module for wireless control, and sensors for navigation.

### Key Components

1. **Arduino Uno Board**: The microcontroller that controls all the functionalities of the robotic car, processing inputs from sensors and executing movement commands.
2. **L298N Motor Driver**: Controls the speed and direction of the motors attached to the car's wheels, allowing it to move forward, backward, and turn.
3. **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measures the distance to obstacles ahead of the car, enabling obstacle detection and avoidance.
4. **SG90 Servo Motor**: Rotates the ultrasonic sensor to scan the area for obstacles.
5. **Motors with Wheels**: Provide the movement for the car, controlled by the L298N motor driver.
6. **Battery Pack**: Powers the Arduino and all connected components, ensuring the car has sufficient energy to operate.
7. **Jumper Wires**: Used to make all necessary electrical connections between the components.
8. **Switch**: Powers the entire system on or off.

### How It Works

- **Bluetooth Control**: The car is controlled via a Bluetooth module (HC-05/06), which receives commands from a paired smartphone or Bluetooth-enabled device. Commands include moving forward, backward, turning left or right, and stopping.
  
- **Obstacle Detection and Avoidance**: The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor mounted on the SG90 Servo Motor scans the front of the car. If an obstacle is detected within a certain range, the car stops, reverses, and attempts to avoid the obstacle by turning.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect the **L298N motor driver** to the **motors with wheels** and the **Arduino Uno board**.
   - Attach the **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** to the servo motor and connect them to the Arduino.
   - Wire the **Bluetooth module** to the Arduinoâ€™s RX and TX pins.
   - Use **jumper wires** to make all the necessary connections between components.
   - Power the system using the **battery pack** and include a **switch** for easy power control.

2. **Software Setup**:
   - Upload the provided Arduino code to the **Arduino Uno board**.
   - Pair the Bluetooth module with a smartphone or Bluetooth device using a Bluetooth terminal app.
   - Send control commands to the car and observe its response.

3. **Testing**:
   - Test each command to ensure the car responds correctly.
   - Place obstacles in front of the car to verify the obstacle detection and avoidance feature.

### Conclusion

This project is a hands-on way to learn about robotics, electronics, and programming. By integrating the listed components, you can create a functional robotic car that can be controlled remotely and intelligently navigates around obstacles.
